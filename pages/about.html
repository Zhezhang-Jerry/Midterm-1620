    I am Jerry, and I born in Wuhan <em>where is the first place to report the covid-19</em>, China. 
        I stay in Canada for about 8 years. I used to love playing video games, <em>but I got almost banned after I am getting married.</em>
        I am very interested in any program in <strong>coding</strong>, and not good at <strong> remembering those theories</strong>.
        <em>I will try my best in this course!
